# sthrottle

**Simple throttle quadrant for flight simulators.** Firmware based on the STM32F103 MCU. It features 3 axes (throttle, propeller pitch, mixture) on potentiometers (tested on 5K and 60K) and one button that can be bound on any action e.g toggle thrust reversers.

# features
* 3 analog axes (throttle, prop, mixture)
* Software drift compenstaion and output filtration on axes (user-configurable with one potentiometer)
* Calibration (user-callable).
* MSFS/X-plane mode switch (TODO, not yet implemented - check the source for more information)

# components

* 4 potentiometers around 5K-50K range (tested on 5K) 
* 1 resistor around 220 ohm 
* Any LED at your taste
* 3 tactile buttons (both 4 or 2 pin)
